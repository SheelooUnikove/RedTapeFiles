                <h3>Men's Shoes for Jeans</h3>
                <span><img src="images/website/style_guide/img1.jpg"></span>
                <p>You can wear almost any color or style of shoe with jeans, but avoid very shiny shoes that were obviously intended for more dressier outfits. <br><br>
Boots, lug soles, sneakers, loafers and sandals all work great with jeans, so you may find it helpful to let the style of your shirt guide you. <br><br>For example, a sporty, polo shirt might work with a loafer; t-shirts go well with sneakers or retro-style shoes; long, artsy button-downs work well with sandals or contemporary styles. </p>

                <h3>Men's Shoes for Dress Pants</h3>
                <span><img src="images/website/style_guide/img2.jpg"></span>
                <p>With dress pants, shoot for the same type of shoe that you might wear with a suit. Shinier materials usually indicate a dressier shoe, as do less bulky heels and soles. Choose a shoe that is the same color or darker than your pants, and if wearing a belt, match your shoes to it.</p>

                <h3>Men's Shoes for Casual Pants</h3>
                <span><img src="images/website/style_guide/img3.jpg"></span>
                <p>Whether you call them Dockers, chinos, or khakis, there are a variety of loafers, oxford and other men's shoes that work well with casual pants. <br><br>Let the ornamentation and style of the shoe guide you towards the look you're trying to achieve. <br><br>For example, a tassle or a buckle is a little more on the dressy side, while a woven pattern or heavy stitching is a little more on the casual side.</p>

                <h3>Do's for </h3>
                
                <h4>1. Clean-up your feet</h4>
                <p>Face it, your feet haven’t seen the light of day in six months so do everyone a favor and clean them up. If you're brave you can have a pedicure, if not scrub and make them shine.</p>
                
                <h4>2. Buy the right sized flip-flops</h4>
                <p>You don’t want to be falling out the back of them or tripping over them on your way to the beach.</p>
                
                <h4>3. Wear the right pair with the right outfit </h4>
                <p>Wearing cheap, foam men’s flip-flops to the beach is cool, wearing them on a first date with khakis and an expensive shirt is not. Have a few pairs to choose from and dress the part.</p>

                <h3>Don't for</h3>
                
                <h4>1. Don't wear flip-flops to work</h4>
                <p>You’re there to get a job done and earn respect. It’s tough to do that when everyone is focused on your toe jam. On an unrelated note, this goes for tank-tops too.</p>
                
                <h4>2. Don't wait to buy a new pair:</h4>
                <p>They’re pretty inexpensive so make sure and buy a new pair a year or at least every other year. Remember, you wear them in the summer and sweat like heck. They get nasty.</p>
                
                <h4>3. Don't ever wear socks with flip-flops</h4>
                <p>I shouldn’t have to even say this, but I did see it twice last year. Mistakes like this hurt us all. </p>
