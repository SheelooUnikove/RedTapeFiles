                <h3>1) WORK BOOTS</h3>
                <span><img src="images/website/fashion_guide/img1.jpg"></span>
                <p>
            Work boots are the most durable of the shoe industry. Be certain that when you are looking for boots to work in you get the steel-toed variety. Some guys mistake hiking boots for work boots and vice versa. If you’re hiking in a work boot the stitching may rub your foot the wrong way, and if you’re working in a hiking boot and there’s not steel toe, well, you get the idea.<br><br>
Make sure you care for your boots just like any other shoe by brushing suedes, polishing top calf leathers, and treating oil-tanned leathers. This will keep your shoes happy and healthy for years to come. </p>

                <span><img src="images/website/fashion_guide/img2.jpg"></span>
                <p>Sandals are the ill-forgotten-child of the shoe world. Too many guys throw on their sandals and some nasty clothes and head out the door. Nothing could be farther from appropriate. Make sure you keep your sandals properly matched with your outfit.<br><br>
Sandals do not stand up well to the elements and should be wiped down with a cloth each time you wear them. Keeping them clean and polished (or treated or brushed) will them happy long after the tide goes in. More on Sandals</p>

                <p>
            	You standard lace-ups are easy to wear if you put some thought into them. Wear them with your suits and business attire, but also choose the right color to go with the clothes you’ll change into for dinner. Black goes with everything except brown. Brown goes with everything except black, and Burgundy (Cordovan) goes with everything (including black.) Keep the right color palette in mind and the right polish on your shoes and they will shine for you in the conference room and on a hot date. </p>

                <span><img src="images/website/fashion_guide/img4.jpg"></span>
                <p>
            	Most popular man shoes trend is of Leather shoes. They have always been in vogue. Leather is the classic epitome of fashion style.

                <h3>5) Boat</h3>
                <span><img src="images/website/fashion_guide/img5.jpg"></span>
                <p>
            	Boat shoes get abused all too often and that means they need to be dressed properly and handled with some common sense. First, don’t just wear them with anything; wear them with garments that compliment their “boating” nature. If a person who owns a boat docks and gets out to go to dinner they might wear a sport coat and nice slacks or at the very least nice shorts.<br><br>
Caring for them is just like any other shoe. Brush your suedes, treat your oil-tanned leathers and polish top calf. Treat your boat shoes right and you’ll look like a million bucks!

                <h3>6) Dress Boots</h3>
                <span><img src="images/website/fashion_guide/img6.jpg"></span>
                <p>
            	Dress Boots are easy to abuse because they can be worn the wrong way. Make sure your Dress Boots are worn like dress shoes that are hiding the high ankle. When you sit down at a meeting everyone will notice that you have boots on and you’ll enjoy the compliments.<br><br>
Also, don’t go for boots that have crazy designs on the ankle because the ankle is rarely seen and should not be “on display.” Take them from the office, to dinner, to a night on the town just like you would your dress shoes. Polish them just like your dress shoes (all the way up the ankle) and your shoes will stand fast for years. </p>

                <h3>7) Driving Moccasions</h3>
                <span><img src="images/website/fashion_guide/img7.jpg"></span>
                <p>
            Driving Shoes were made for…driving! It’s a crazy concept, but it’s true. Bear in mind, the outsole is run up onto the heel, but that does not mean you can’t wear these shoes outside the car. What else are you going to wear when you get out? Wear them like any other casual shoe and enjoy getting noticed &ndash; folks might think you have a fancy car!<br>
If you do drive in them a lot, make sure you use good judgment. The rubber on the heel is supposed to make the move to the clutch on a stick-shift smoother, so don’t dig in because you’ll ruin the heel that way. Be nice to them and they’ll drive you all the way to retirement! </p>

                <h3>8) Saddle</h3>
                <span><img src="images/website/fashion_guide/img8.jpg"></span>
                <p>
           Saddle shoes are named after; you guessed it, a saddle. Remember how formal equestrian riders dress…fancy. Keep your clothes nice when pairing them with saddles and let the two-tone shoe pop off your feet (usually by pairing it with blues and oranges.)<br><br>
Caring for them is simple as long as you don’t polish them. Use a neutral shoe cream or H.S. Trask’s “Buffalo Butter” to treat the leather and keep scuffs away. Remember, if you don’t keep your shoe care products in your hip pocket the oil from your skin will keep that errant scuff at bay before you sit down to dinner with your date. </p>

                <h3>9) Patent Leathers</h3>
                <span><img src="images/website/fashion_guide/img9.jpg"></span>
                <p>
       Patent Leather, since its discovery in 1818, has maintained its status as one of the classiest shoes on and off of the formal floor.<br><br>
       
Making sure you wear your patent leathers outside the formal affair with confidence is key to the success of your shoe wardrobe. Pair them with your favorite jeans and sport coat so you can hit the town or the conference room with your best-patterned power suit and let your patent leathers truly shine.<br><br>

Caring for your patent leathers is simple: yes, they can get wet; stay away from heavy lifting to avoid creases &ndash; shoe trees are must for in-the-box care; make sure you only use the blackest of black shoe polishes and your best polishing cloth to keep them happy and shiny. </p>

                <p>
           Slip-on shoes are casual by nature. Those appropriate for business casual wear include bit loafers, with a metal link across the middle; monk straps, with a buckle closure; and penny loafers, with a slotted leather band across the top. Tassel loafers, which are exactly what they sound like, are accepted as business formal in some circles while relegated to weekend wear in others. Casual slip-ons can be worn with jeans; dressier variants should be matched with an odd trouser.</p>
