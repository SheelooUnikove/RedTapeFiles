		<h2>26 MEN'S Shoes Rules</h2>
		
		<div class="mens_rule">
		<p>1.       Your shoes should be darker than your pants.<br><br>
        2.       Your shoes should be the most expensive part of your wardrobe.<br><br>
        3.       No socks with sandals.<br><br>
        4.       Buy new flip-flops each summer.<br><br>
        5.       Be careful when wearing sneakers with khakis, you run the risk of looking older than you are.<br><br>
        6.       Your socks should be a nice bridge between your shoes and your pants.<br><br>
        7.       Your dress shoes should always be shined and looking good.<br><br>
        8.      The darker your suit, the darker your shoes.<br><br>
        9.       No flip-flops at work. Unless you work at a surf shop.<br><br>
        10.     Match your socks to your shoes.<br><br>
        11.     Know how to shine your shoes, and if you can't do it, find a professional shoe shiner. You'll get great looking shoes and an interesting conversation.<br><br>
          12.     Always spend money on shoes rather than shirts or pants<br><br>
          13.     Loafers go with just about anything.<br><br>
          14.     When in doubt go conservative over edgy.<br><br>
          15.     Always choose fit over style<br><br>
          16.     Cowboy boots don't work with suits. Unless you are a real, honest to God cowboy.<br><br>
          17.     Be fitted for running shoes if you're going to push yourself.<br><br>
          18.     Wingtips are cool again.<br><br>
          19.     Make sure you have one great pair of boots.<br><br>
          20.     Your shoes should match your belt.<br><br>
          21.     Replace your workout shoes at least every six months.<br><br>
          22.     Don't wear sandals if you have gross feet.<br><br>
          23.     Buy a nice pair of brown oxfords, they go with almost anything.<br><br>
          24.     Splurge once a year on that pair of shoes you really want.<br><br>
          25.     Try out the new athletic shoe trends before training with them.<br><br>
          26.     Although it is a safe bet, socks do not need to match your shoes. Instead, think of your socks as you would a tie - an item that can bring bring the whole outfit together.</p>
